This application was created for learning purposes. Much of the code came from "Code with Mosh" learning program. I've used several resources for the application to come to this point. 

This application utilizes node.js for the backend language. The database service is MongoDB. The front end uses the React framework.

#Quick Start

Preconditions:
You must have NPM installed.

Get Started:
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the backend folder
3. Enter "npm install"
4. Navigate to the client folder
5. Enter "npm install"
6. Navigate to the backend folder
7. Enter "Nodemon server.js" and press enter to install npm packages
8. Navigate to the client folder

You should be able to see a website hosted locally(your pc).
Feel free to mess around with the application, and make suggestions, or raise issues.
